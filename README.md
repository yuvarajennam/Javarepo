Java DSA – Practice

This repository is a collection of Java programs focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), particularly in the area of strings and pattern-based problems.

As part of my journey from advanced beginner to intermediate Java developer, I’ve used this space to reinforce core concepts and practice solving a wide range of coding challenges. Each file serves as both a learning exercise and a milestone in my understanding of Java DSA.

What's Included

String manipulation problems

Pattern printing (stars, numbers, alphabet patterns)

Restaurant menu simulations

Number-based pattern problems

Miscellaneous beginner-to-intermediate logic building exercises

Purpose

This repository serves as:

A personal log of my DSA learning progress

A reference for revisiting logic and structure

A way to demonstrate consistent practice and dedication to mastering Java
